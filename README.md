# Turtle-Bot ROS Maze Solver

Welcome to the **Turtle-Bot ROS Maze Solver** repository! This project demonstrates how to program a TurtleBot3 robot to autonomously navigate and solve a maze using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The robot utilizes sensor data, path-planning algorithms, and ROS navigation stack components to explore and escape the maze.

## Overview
This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of ROS and the TurtleBot3 platform in solving maze navigation challenges. The robot uses LIDAR and other sensors to detect walls, avoid obstacles, and find the optimal path to the maze exit. The implementation includes:
- Maze mapping using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
- Path planning with the ROS navigation stack.
- Autonomous exploration and decision-making algorithms.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **ROS Noetic** (or another compatible ROS distribution).
- **TurtleBot3 packages** (e.g., `turtlebot3`, `turtlebot3_simulations`).
- **Gazebo** for simulation (optional but recommended).
- **Python 3** and necessary ROS Python libraries.
- **Git** for cloning the repository.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedZahran02/Turtle-Bot-Ros-Maze-Solver.git
   cd Turtle-Bot-Ros-Maze-Solver
   ```

2. **Set Up the Workspace:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
   cp -r Turtle-Bot-Ros-Maze-Solver ~/catkin_ws/src/
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure all required ROS packages are installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlebot3 ros-noetic-turtlebot3-simulations ros-noetic-navigation
   ```

4. **Download TurtleBot3 Models (if using Gazebo):**
   ```bash
   export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
   ```

## Usage
1. **Launch the Simulation:**
   If you're using Gazebo for simulation, launch the maze world and TurtleBot3:
   ```bash
   roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_maze.launch
   ```

2. **Run the Maze Solver:**
   Start the maze-solving node:
   ```bash
   rosrun turtlebot_maze_solver maze_solver.py
   ```

3. **Monitor the Robot:**
   Use tools like `rviz` to visualize the robot's progress, map, and planned path:
   ```bash
   roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch
   ```

4. **Analyze Results:**
   The robot will autonomously navigate the maze, map the environment, and find the exit. You can observe the process in real-time.
